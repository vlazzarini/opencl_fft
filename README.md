OpenCL 1D Radix-2 FFT and Convolution
================

This repository contains an implementation of the radix-2 FFT for
one-dimensional data. It contains code for both complex-to-complex
and real-to-complex operations. The main motivation is to provide support
for the parallelisation of audio processing operations in OpenCL
devices such as GPUs, CPUs and accellerators.

The repository includes a complete implementation of fast partitioned
convolution, based on the FFT code, as well as direct time-domain
convolution. Csound opcodes for linear time-invariant and time-varying
convolution, as well as complex-to-complex and
real-to-complex/complex-to-real FFTs are also provided.
